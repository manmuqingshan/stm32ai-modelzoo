# Yolov11n_seg

## **Use case** : `Instance segmentation`

# Model description

Yolov11n_seg is a lightweight and efficient model designed for instance segmentation tasks. It is part of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models, known for their real-time object detection capabilities. The "n" in Yolov11n_seg indicates that it is a nano version, optimized for speed and resource efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on devices with limited computational power, such as mobile devices and embedded systems.

Yolov11n_seg is implemented in Pytorch by Ultralytics and is quantized in int8 format using tensorflow lite converter.

## Retraining and Integration in a Simple Example
Please refer to the stm32ai-modelzoo-services GitHub [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo-services).
For instance segmentation, the models are stored in the Ultralytics repository. You can find them at the following link: [Ultralytics YOLOv8-STEdgeAI Models](https://github.com/stm32-hotspot/ultralytics/blob/main/examples/YOLOv8-STEdgeAI/stedgeai_models/).

Please refer to the [Ultralytics documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/#train) to retrain the model.
