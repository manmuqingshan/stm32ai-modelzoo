# Yolov11n_pose quantized

## **Use case** : `Pose estimation`

# Model description

Yolov11n_pose is a lightweight and efficient model designed for multi pose estimation tasks. It is part of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models, known for their real-time object detection capabilities. The "n" in Yolov11n_pose indicates that it is a nano version, optimized for speed and resource efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on devices with limited computational power, such as mobile devices and embedded systems.

Yolov11n_pose is implemented in Pytorch by Ultralytics and is quantized in int8 format using tensorflow lite converter.
